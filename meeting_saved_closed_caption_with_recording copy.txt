[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:00:28
Then maybe caught or I got my transcript, Jo.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:00:39
Time they're in court.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:00:53
And now bone can be recorded.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:00:56
I do know how to do it.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:00
Okay. How many… Okay.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:01:03
Oh.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:04
Good job.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:01:08
So hello. I'm doing good.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:10
Hello, how are you?

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:15
Okay.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:01:16
So now I'm going to ask you a few questions about like communication tools in your good work.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:25
Yep.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:01:27
So are you ready? Cool.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:30
Yep. Yep.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:01:32
All right, so first question is What obstacle do you face in coordinating tasks or setting up meetings with your groups.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:44
I think in coordinating tasks or setting up meetings with my group I have had experience with a group of five people in a final year project.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:01:55
For my bachelor degree and then in the group Some of the people are very busy and they work at the same time as they study.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:02:05
So it's very hard to find a time that all of us can attend a meeting at the same

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:02:18
Part of

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:02:26
Them even… pre-rided some of my group mates and some of The editor are working very hardly And it's really messy in the project when we were trying to formulate a plan for our company as This is a group project and then our roles are not super clear so that

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:02:48
Sometimes our or communications would be really or as three coordinating tasks back on who do which parts.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:03:02
I see. So next question. What tools do you currently use for communicating vocal work.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:03:14
For communication, most of my group mates uses messenger or instagram the direct message function in Instagram because it's a very convenient and popular social media both of them are very popular amounts. You need H students.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:03:36
And we can just at each other on the social media and then we can message one another.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:03:45
By our phones or like on the computer And then it's even more convenient than meeting face to face or like emails because nowadays no people check their emails and It's very instant from our phones.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:04:04
Okay. Well, next question. Can you share a recent experience of group work using these communication tools.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:04:16
A recent experience is in last semester when I was doing uh project with some of my peers. Actually, there are two of my peers and then we use messenger bought it to communicate uh like what we do uh when we don't beat each other that often

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:04:37
And then one of the great mates are really attentive to messages and she replies very promptly whenever there's a message over there.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:04:44
But another member is kind of a free rider or like he replies very slowly So it's sometimes very frustrated to wait for their messages But in general, I think the communication to that we use.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:05:03
And people use it wisely and reply promptly like in a reasonable time it's a very convenient tool to use to communicate with one another because it's more handy and more convenient to use compares to email or like scheduling face-to-face meetings that you need.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:05:22
Because there's no time or geographical constraints for using communication tools.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:05:31
That's a very detailed answer, huh? All right. Next question.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:05:40
What do you like about your current tools and what part of it could be improved.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:05:49
I think for… Something that I like is instant messaging, social distancing uh instant.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:06:00
Messaging medias and like how quick uh we can receive a message or like send a message via the apps and it's also very easy to track our messages because we can simply use the search function and type in some keywords and then we can look back to the relative messages

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:06:21
In the messenger or like instagram And also we can also and track whether we have completed our assigned work.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:06:34
Since everybody might have messaged the group chat and then it could be there could be a lot of messages at the same time but then how we can look back to the relevant messages or like um to track something we can

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:06:53
It can be a bit annoying to just grow through everything and then it's much more easier to use search function.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:07:03
As for improvements. I think those instant messaging social medias i think it's quite good and yeah but sometimes people would like to use And… So audio message function which there are good and bad for like people who do not like to type or like

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:07:30
They don't have time to type things quickly. Both record their message on their phones and send it out. But then I think it's hard to track the messages if there's um if they do not transcript uh script.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:07:55
Since it's just an audio and we can't use the search function to search for the audios like the content in the audios.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:08:07
I see. I see a point.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:08:12
Let's move on to next questions. So how well do your current tools handle task management or track group progress?

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:08:23
I think it's pretty good, kind of easy to track And the messages, as we have just talked about Like when we're typing the keywords and then we look back to the relative messages we can quickly find the relevant messages.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:08:44
And also for handle tasks like we have come we can check whether we can check Some people have completed their assigned work or not But from the messages but at the same time, there could be a bit of problem

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:09:04
When there's too many messages and some of them are irrelevant to the project or the Good book.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:09:12
Like people sometimes would reply like irrelevant or like they reply something else or like there's so many things going on at the same time so It could be even if we type in a keyword, it could be a bit

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:09:29
Time consuming to find the relevant information.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:09:38
That's very true. Let's move on to the next question.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:09:44
What features would you want? In an ideal communication system for your group work.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:09:53
I think maybe a reminder function like for example sometimes when you are bc and you saw the message but you forgot and then you clicked into the message it will automatically help you send the messages and then sometimes you forgot to reply and then after a period of time

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:10:14
You still forgot to reply and then you won't reply to that person and it's sometimes very frustrated as the one who sent the message But then if there could be a reminder function so after seeing the messages and if I don't have time or I don't know the answer yet, I can click on the reminder function to remind me to reply like maybe

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:10:39
At night or like tomorrow and then i can go back to that message again and then reply the relevant information to that person.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:10:54
All right. That's a very good idea for a new function.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:10:59
Well, finally, the last question. If a new system were designed to address all the issues above.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:11:10
All the challenges which use it, why and why not.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:11:15
I guess it really depends on the how popular the social media are or like the system are like if And if I'm the only person or like the only very few people who switch to the new system and then most of my friends are still using the old system like Facebook messenger

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:11:42
So I might not use it since it's hard to communicate with one another when we were in different platforms.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:11:50
But on the other hand, if a lot of people like my friends also switch to the new systems So I think it would be really convenient for us as um there's functions are really well designed like what we have mentioned like the reminder function i like transcripting

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:12:13
The audio messages. These are all like very… good functions and um Which helped us to help us better to communicate with one another in the communication tools.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:12:35
Cool. That's it for our interview.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:12:41
And then thanks for participating. I hope you have a good life.

[Chung Yee Ian Tse] 01:12:47
Okay, my pleasure. I don't gone they got the Lego call transcript.

[Jimmy Xu] 01:12:48
See you. Okay, see you.
